Check if the functionality exists before creating the functionality\n4. Database entities must have their primary key in the format {{tableName}}Id, such as the \"Booking\" table's primary key would be \"BookingId\"\n5. We never use Automapper, use Mapperly if you want to use a mapping library\n6. For design, the site has to use the layout and theme as described in the style_guide.md file\n7. For project context, read the relevant .md file targeted to the piece of work you're currently doing\n\nPlease review the file being created/modified and ensure it follows these standards. If violations are found, suggest corrections."
