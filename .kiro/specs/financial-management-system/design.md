# Financial Management System - Design Document

## Overview

The Financial Management System is designed as a comprehensive financial hub that integrates seamlessly with the existing MeAndMyDog platform architecture. The system provides dual interfaces - one optimized for service providers managing their business finances, and another for pet owners tracking their pet-related expenses. The design emphasizes automation, user experience, and compliance while maintaining the platform's mobile-first approach and golden theme.
