# Story 1: Authentication Integration & User Profile Foundation

## Overview
This section defines the requirements for seamless integration of the enhanced dashboard with the existing authentication system and user profile management, ensuring zero disruption to current login functionality while enabling personalized dashboard experiences.

## Story Definition
**As a pet owner,**  
**I want to access a new personalized dashboard through the existing login system,**  
**so that I can experience enhanced functionality without any disruption to my current account access or user session management.**

## Technical Context

### Existing Authentication Infrastructure
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core Identity with JWT tokens
- **User Roles**: User, Admin, PetOwner, ServiceProvider, Both
- **Security Features**: 
  - Two-factor authentication with TOTP
  - Account lockout (5 attempts, 30-minute lockout)
  - Refresh tokens (7-day expiry)
  - Password requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, digits, symbols)
- **Database Entities**: ApplicationUser, UserProfile, RefreshToken, UserActivity

### Integration Requirements

#### Authentication Flow Integration
- Dashboard route must integrate with existing authentication guards
- JWT token validation and refresh must work seamlessly during dashboard usage
- No additional login requirements for existing authenticated users
- Proper handling of authentication state changes

#### User Role and Permission Management
- Dashboard content must adapt based on existing user roles
- Role-based authorization for dashboard features
- Proper handling of multi-role users (e.g., PetOwner + ServiceProvider)
- Integration with existing role-based routing

## Functional Requirements

### FR1.1: Seamless Dashboard Access
- **Requirement**: New dashboard route accessible through existing authentication guards
- **Integration Point**: Existing Vue.js router with authentication middleware
- **Implementation**: Extend current route protection to include dashboard routes
- **Success Criteria**: Authenticated users can access dashboard without re-authentication

### FR1.2: User Role Adaptation
- **Requirement**: Dashboard displays role-appropriate content and features
- **Integration Point**: Existing user context and role management system
- **Implementation**: Leverage current role-based content rendering patterns
- **Success Criteria**: Dashboard adapts content based on user roles without manual configuration

### FR1.3: JWT Token Compatibility
- **Requirement**: Dashboard operations maintain existing JWT token refresh behavior
- **Integration Point**: Existing JWT authentication middleware and token refresh logic
- **Implementation**: Ensure dashboard API calls follow established token patterns
- **Success Criteria**: Token refresh occurs transparently during dashboard usage

### FR1.4: User Profile Data Integration
- **Requirement**: Dashboard accesses existing user and dog profile data
- **Integration Point**: Current UserProfile and DogProfile entities
- **Implementation**: Utilize existing data access patterns and repositories
- **Success Criteria**: User and dog data displays correctly in dashboard widgets

## Technical Specifications

### Database Integration
```sql
-- Extend existing UserProfile table for dashboard preferences
ALTER TABLE UserProfile ADD DashboardPreferences NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL;

-- Create dashboard analytics table following existing patterns
CREATE TABLE DashboardAnalytics (
    Id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT NEWID(),
    UserId NVARCHAR(450) NOT NULL,
    EventType NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    EventData NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
    CreatedAt DATETIME2 NOT NULL DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    CONSTRAINT FK_DashboardAnalytics_Users FOREIGN KEY (UserId) REFERENCES AspNetUsers(Id)
);
```

### API Integration Points
```csharp
// Extend existing authentication middleware for dashboard routes
public class DashboardAuthorizationMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/dashboard"))
        {
            // Leverage existing authentication checks
            var user = context.User;
            if (!user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                context.Response.Redirect("/auth/login");
                return;
            }
        }
        await _next(context);
    }
}

// Dashboard-specific user context service
public interface IDashboardUserService
{
    Task<DashboardUserContext> GetUserContextAsync(string userId);
    Task<bool> HasDashboardAccessAsync(string userId);
}
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Extend existing auth store for dashboard context
interface DashboardAuthState extends AuthState {
  dashboardAccess: boolean;
  userRoles: string[];
  dashboardPreferences: DashboardPreferences;
}

// Dashboard route protection
const dashboardRoutes = [
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    component: Dashboard,
    meta: { requiresAuth: true, roles: ['PetOwner', 'ServiceProvider'] }
  }
];
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1.1: Authentication Guard Integration
- **Given**: An authenticated user navigates to the dashboard
- **When**: The dashboard route is accessed
- **Then**: The user is granted access without additional authentication
- **And**: The existing JWT token remains valid and functional

### AC1.2: Role-Based Content Display
- **Given**: Users with different roles (PetOwner, ServiceProvider, Both)
- **When**: They access the dashboard
- **Then**: Content and widgets are displayed according to their role permissions
- **And**: Multi-role users see combined relevant content

### AC1.3: Session Continuity
- **Given**: A user is actively using the dashboard
- **When**: Their JWT token approaches expiration
- **Then**: The token is refreshed automatically using existing mechanisms
- **And**: Dashboard functionality continues without interruption

### AC1.4: User Data Access
- **Given**: An authenticated user with existing profile and dog data
- **When**: They access the dashboard
- **Then**: Their profile information and dog details are correctly displayed
- **And**: Data access follows existing privacy and permission settings

### AC1.5: Logout Functionality
- **Given**: A user is on the dashboard
- **When**: They choose to log out
- **Then**: The logout process works as expected
- **And**: They are redirected to the appropriate post-logout page

## Integration Verification Points

### IV1.1: Existing Login Flow Compatibility
- Verify existing login flows redirect to enhanced dashboard without breaking current user sessions
- Ensure authentication tokens remain valid across dashboard navigation
- Confirm deep-linking and bookmarking behavior remains intact

### IV1.2: User Role Validation
- Confirm existing user role validation continues to work properly with new dashboard route authorization
- Verify role-based content filtering works correctly
- Ensure multi-role users receive appropriate combined permissions

### IV1.3: JWT Token Management
- Validate that existing JWT token refresh mechanisms function correctly during dashboard usage
- Ensure real-time updates don't interfere with token management
- Confirm token expiry handling maintains existing behavior

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1.1: Performance
- Dashboard authentication checks must not add more than 50ms to page load time
- User data retrieval for dashboard must leverage existing caching mechanisms
- Authentication state checks must not impact existing application performance

### NFR1.2: Security
