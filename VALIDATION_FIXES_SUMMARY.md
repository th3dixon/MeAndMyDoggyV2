# Code Validation Fixes Summary

## Fixes Completed

### 1. Provider DTOs (COMPLETED ✅)
Split the following files into individual class files:
- `ProviderUpgradeDto.cs` → Split into 9 separate files
- `CreateInvoiceDto.cs` → Split into 3 separate files  
- `ProviderDashboardDto.cs` → Split into 8 separate files

### 2. Validation Attributes (COMPLETED ✅)
- `PetValidationAttributes.cs` → Split into 6 separate attribute files:
  - ValidPetAgeAttribute.cs
  - ValidMicrochipNumberAttribute.cs
  - ValidPetWeightAttribute.cs
  - ValidPetHeightAttribute.cs
  - ValidPetGenderAttribute.cs
  - ValidPetNameAttribute.cs

### 3. Middleware (COMPLETED ✅)
- `ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs` → Split into 3 separate files:
  - ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs (main class only)
  - ErrorResponse.cs
  - ErrorHandlingMiddlewareExtensions.cs

### 4. Incomplete Implementations (COMPLETED ✅)
- Fixed TODO in `DashboardController.cs` - Implemented API call for pet photo upload
- Fixed NotImplementedException in `MobileIntegrationService.cs` - Implemented RefreshMobileApiTokenAsync method

## Improvements Made
- Reduced error violations significantly
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Fixed all critical incomplete implementations
- Better adherence to single responsibility principle

## Remaining Work
Due to the large number of files (500+), the following categories still need attention:
- Hubs (2 files)
- Controllers (multiple files with inline DTOs)
- Mobile DTOs (1 large file with many classes)
- Dashboard DTOs (multiple files)
- Other DTOs (various files)
- XML documentation for public classes

## Estimated Compliance Score
Based on fixes completed, the compliance score should improve from 94.9% to approximately 96-97%.
