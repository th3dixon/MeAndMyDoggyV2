# User Registration and Onboarding System - Complete Specification

## Introduction

The User Registration and Onboarding System provides a comprehensive, user-friendly registration experience for both standard pet owners and service providers on the MeAndMyDog platform. The system handles different user types with distinct subscription models: standard users have free accounts only, while service providers have both free and premium subscription options. The registration flow is designed to minimize friction while collecting necessary information for service providers including service offerings and pricing. The system emphasizes conversion optimization, progressive disclosure, and seamless onboarding experiences.

## Component Overview
The User Registration & Onboarding system provides a dual-path registration flow for pet owners (free only) and service providers (free + premium tiers), with comprehensive onboarding to ensure profile completion and platform engagement.

## Database Schema

### Primary Tables
- **AspNetUsers** (extended) - Core user identity
- **Addresses** - User location data
- **UserOnboarding** - Tracks onboarding progress
- **UserPreferences** - Platform preferences
- **EmailVerifications** - Email verification tokens
- **PasswordResets** - Password reset tokens

## Technical Implementation Details

### Password Security

```csharp
public class PasswordHasher
{
    private const int SaltSize = 128 / 8;
    private const int KeySize = 256 / 8;
    private const int Iterations = 10000;
    
    public string HashPassword(string password)
    {
        using var algorithm = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(
            password,
            SaltSize,
            Iterations,
            HashAlgorithmName.SHA256);
        
        var salt = algorithm.Salt;
        var key = algorithm.GetBytes(KeySize);
        
        return $"{Iterations}.{Convert.ToBase64String(salt)}.{Convert.ToBase64String(key)}";
    }
}
```

### Email Verification

```csharp
public class EmailVerificationService
{
    private readonly TimeSpan TokenExpiry = TimeSpan.FromHours(24);
    
    public async Task<string> GenerateVerificationToken(string userId, string email)
    {
        var token = GenerateSecureToken();
        var verification = new EmailVerification
        {
            UserId = userId,
            Email = email,
            Token = token,
            Purpose = VerificationPurpose.Registration,
            ExpiresAt = DateTime.UtcNow.Add(TokenExpiry)
        };
        
        await _context.EmailVerifications.AddAsync(verification);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        
        return token;
    }
    
    private string GenerateSecureToken()
    {
        var bytes = new byte[32];
        using var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.Create();
        rng.GetBytes(bytes);
        return Convert.ToBase64String(bytes)
            .Replace("+", "-")
            .Replace("/", "_")
            .Replace("=", "");
    }
}
```

### Social Authentication

```csharp
public class SocialAuthService
{
    public async Task<AuthResult> AuthenticateWithGoogle(string idToken)
    {
        var payload = await ValidateGoogleToken(idToken);
        
        var user = await _userManager.FindByEmailAsync(payload.Email);
        if (user == null)
        {
            user = await CreateUserFromSocialLogin(payload, "Google");
        }
        
        await LinkSocialAccount(user.Id, "Google", payload.Subject);
        
        return await GenerateAuthTokens(user);
    }
    
    private async Task<GoogleJsonWebSignature.Payload> ValidateGoogleToken(string idToken)
    {
        var settings = new GoogleJsonWebSignature.ValidationSettings
        {
            Audience = new[] { _googleClientId }
        };
        
        return await GoogleJsonWebSignature.ValidateAsync(idToken, settings);
    }
}
```

### Onboarding State Machine

```csharp
public class OnboardingStateMachine
{
    private readonly Dictionary<UserType, List<OnboardingStep>> _steps;
    
    public OnboardingStateMachine()
    {
        _steps = new Dictionary<UserType, List<OnboardingStep>>
        {
            [UserType.PetOwner] = new List<OnboardingStep>
            {
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "profile-photo", Required = false },
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "first-dog", Required = true },
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "preferences", Required = true },
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "find-providers", Required = false }
            },
            [UserType.ServiceProvider] = new List<OnboardingStep>
            {
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "business-profile", Required = true },
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "services", Required = true },
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "availability", Required = true },
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "pricing", Required = true },
                new OnboardingStep { Id = "verification", Required = false }
            }
        };
    }
    
    public OnboardingStep GetNextStep(string userId, UserType userType)
    {
        var completedSteps = GetCompletedSteps(userId);
        var allSteps = _steps[userType];
        
        return allSteps.FirstOrDefault(s => 
            !completedSteps.Contains(s.Id) && 
            (s.Required || !HasSkippedStep(userId, s.Id)));
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Registration Security
1. **Email Verification**: Required for all accounts
2. **Password Requirements**:
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - At least one uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
   - Password strength meter
   - Common password blacklist
3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Registration: 5 attempts per IP per hour
   - Email verification: 3 resends per day
   - Password reset: 3 attempts per day
4. **CAPTCHA**: For suspicious registration patterns

### Data Protection
1. **Personal Data Encryption**: All PII encrypted at rest
2. **Secure Token Generation**: Cryptographically secure random tokens
3. **Session Management**: 
   - Secure, httpOnly cookies
   - Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
4. **Audit Trail**: All registration attempts logged

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
```csharp
// Redis caching for onboarding state
public async Task<OnboardingStatus> GetOnboardingStatus(string userId)
{
    var cacheKey = $"onboarding:status:{userId}";
    var cached = await _cache.GetAsync<OnboardingStatus>(cacheKey);
    
    if (cached != null) return cached;
    
    var status = await _repository.GetOnboardingStatus(userId);
    await _cache.SetAsync(cacheKey, status, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10));
    
    return status;
}
```

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on email fields for quick lookups
- Partitioned tables for audit logs
- Async operations throughout

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
1. **Registration Funnel**:
   - Start rate
   - Step completion rates
   - Drop-off points
   - Time to complete
2. **Verification Metrics**:
   - Email verification rate
   - Time to verify
   - Resend rate
3. **Social Login Usage**:
   - Provider breakdown
   - Conversion rates
4. **Error Tracking**:
   - Failed registrations
   - Validation errors
   - System errors

### Event Tracking
```csharp
public async Task TrackRegistrationEvent(string eventName, Dictionary<string, object> properties)
{
    var analyticsEvent = new UserAnalytics
    {
        UserId = properties.GetValueOrDefault("userId")?.ToString(),
        EventType = eventName,
        EventCategory = "Registration",
        EventData = JsonSerializer.Serialize(properties),
        Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow
    };
    
    await _context.UserAnalytics.AddAsync(analyticsEvent);
}
```

## Integration Points

### Email Service (SendGrid)
```csharp
public async Task SendVerificationEmail(string email, string token)
{
    var template = await _templateService.GetTemplate("email-verification");
    var verificationUrl = $"{_baseUrl}/verify-email?token={token}";
    
    var msg = new SendGridMessage
    {
        From = new EmailAddress("noreply@meandmydoggy.co.uk", "MeAndMyDoggy"),
        Subject = "Verify your email address",
        HtmlContent = template.Replace("{{verification_url}}", verificationUrl)
    };
    
    msg.AddTo(email);
    await _sendGridClient.SendEmailAsync(msg);
}
```

### Payment Processing (Stripe) - For Premium Providers
```csharp
public async Task<Subscription> CreateProviderSubscription(string providerId, string paymentMethodId)
{
    var customer = await CreateOrGetStripeCustomer(providerId);
    
    await _stripe.PaymentMethods.AttachAsync(paymentMethodId, new PaymentMethodAttachOptions
    {
        Customer = customer.Id
    });
    
    var subscription = await _stripe.Subscriptions.CreateAsync(new SubscriptionCreateOptions
    {
        Customer = customer.Id,
        Items = new List<SubscriptionItemOptions>
        {
            new SubscriptionItemOptions
            {
                Price = _premiumPriceId // £15-19.99/month
            }
        },
        DefaultPaymentMethod = paymentMethodId,
        TrialPeriodDays = 14 // Free trial
    });
    
    return subscription;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Registration Errors
```csharp
public enum RegistrationError
{
    EmailAlreadyExists = 1001,
    InvalidPassword = 1002,
    InvalidEmail = 1003,
    PhoneNumberInvalid = 1004,
    BusinessNameTaken = 1005,
    PaymentMethodFailed = 1006,
    VerificationTokenInvalid = 1007,
    VerificationTokenExpired = 1008,
    SocialLoginFailed = 1009,
    RateLimitExceeded = 1010
}

public class RegistrationException : Exception
{
    public RegistrationError ErrorCode { get; }
    public Dictionary<string, string> ValidationErrors { get; }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class RegistrationServiceTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task RegisterPetOwner_ValidData_CreatesUser()
    {
        // Arrange
        var request = new PetOwnerRegistrationRequest
        {
            Email = "test@example.com",
            Password = "Test123!@#",
            FirstName = "John",
            LastName = "Doe"
        };
        
        // Act
        var result = await _service.RegisterPetOwner(request);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.IsNotNull(result.UserId);
        Assert.IsTrue(result.EmailVerificationRequired);
    }
}
```

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dual-Path Registration Flow

**User Story:** As a new user, I want a clear and simple registration process that adapts to my user type, so that I can quickly create an account without confusion about subscription options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL present two clear user type options: "Pet Owner" and "Service Provider" with descriptive explanations
2. WHEN a user selects "Pet Owner" THEN the system SHALL initiate a streamlined registration flow with only free account creation (no subscription selection)
3. WHEN a user selects "Service Provider" THEN the system SHALL initiate an enhanced registration flow with service selection capabilities but no upfront subscription choice
4. WHEN a user changes their user type selection THEN the system SHALL dynamically update the registration form without losing previously entered data
5. WHEN a user completes basic registration THEN the system SHALL create the appropriate account type with correct default subscription (free for both initially)
6. WHEN a service provider completes registration THEN the system SHALL automatically set up their provider profile with selected services and pricing
7. WHEN the registration flow is interrupted THEN the system SHALL save progress and allow users to resume registration from where they left off

### Requirement 2: Standard Pet Owner Registration

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want a quick and simple registration process, so that I can start using the platform immediately without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pet owner registers THEN the system SHALL collect essential information: name, email, password, and postcode only
2. WHEN a pet owner enters their information THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation with helpful error messages and suggestions
3. WHEN a pet owner completes registration THEN the system SHALL create a free account with no subscription options or premium features presented
4. WHEN a pet owner verifies their email THEN the system SHALL activate their account and redirect to the dashboard with pet registration wizard
5. WHEN a pet owner accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL present a prominent call-to-action wizard for adding their first pet
