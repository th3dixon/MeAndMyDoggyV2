- Have backup implementation ready
- Parallel development of core features

#### 2. Real-Time Performance (Week 3)
**Risk**: SignalR performance issues under load
**Mitigation**:
- Implement Redis backplane early
- Load testing from week 4
- Monitor connection counts and message throughput

#### 3. Premium Feature Complexity (Week 6)
**Risk**: Permission system becomes overly complex
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple subscription checks
- Add complexity gradually
- Clear feature flag system for rollback
